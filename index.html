      <h2>Decentralized Corporate Identifiers (enterprise)</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          There are many types of identifiers that corporations use today
          including tax identification numbers (e.g. 238-42-3893), Legal
          Entity Identifiers (e.g. 5493000IBP32UQZ0KL24), Data Universal
          Numbering System identifiers (aka. DUNS Number) (e.g. 150483782),
          and many more that communicate the unique identity of an organization.
          None of these numbers enable an organization to self-issue an
          identifier or to use the number to cryptographically authenticate or
          digitally sign agreements. A great number of business to business
          and business to custome transactions could be executed more quickly
          and with greater assurance of the validity of the transaction if a
          mechanism to self-issue cryptographic identifiers were created.
        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          A North American government would like to ensure that the supply
          chain that feeds electronic products into the country is secure. As
          a result, a new method of submitting digital documentation to Customs
          is enabled that requires that all documentation is provided as
          machine-readable digitally signed data. Digitally signed documentation
          is collected at each stage of the manufacturing, packaging, and
          shipping process. This documentation is then submitted to Customs
          upon the products entry into the country where all digital signatures
          are verified on the documentation. Some aspects of the signed
          documentation, such as firmware hashes and checksums, are then used
          by Customs and downstream customers to verify that the products have
          not been tampered with after leaving the manufacturing facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decentralized Identifiers are chosen in order to ensure 1) low
          management overhead for the government, 2) self-management of
          identifiers and cryptographic key material, and 3) a competitive
          marketplace.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The requirement of downstream customers to use the same documentation
          and digital signature mechanisms that were provided to Customs is the
          sticky wicket in this scenario. Governments often create ad-hoc
          solutions for their import solutions, which make securing the global
          supply chain difficult as each government has their own method of
          securing the supply chain and identifying corporations that downstream
          customers need to integrate with. If you are a global company, that
          means integrating with many supply chain systems (each with different
          capabilities). As such, any securing of the supply chain with downstream
          customers must then depend on the country-specific corporate
          identification and PKI solution, which leads to ad-hoc solutions that
          drive up the cost of doing business across borders.
        </p>
        <p>
          A supply chain identifier solution that is simple, self-administered,
          built on global standards, is flexible in the cryptographic mechanisms
          used to authenticate, and can be used by governments and downstream
          customers with little to no modification to the regional government
          or corporate systems does not exist today.

          Many Decentralized Identifier use cases focus on Self-Sovereign
          Identity and individuals. This use case focuses on organizations and
          their departments as entities that would also benefit from
          Decentralized Identifiers.

      <h2>Life-long, Recipient-owned Credentials (education)</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Educational Verifiable Credentials offer benefits over traditional
          educational credentials in that the recipient is able to store and
          share their credentials, and a third party may independently verify
          the claim (without necessarily consulting the issuer). This provides
          the promise of recipient-owned long-lived credentials that the
          recipient may use even if the issuing institution goes out of
          business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usability issues around cryptographic keys introduce a threat to
          achieving this goal; if the recipient loses their private key, they
          lose ability to prove ownership of a credential. The existing ways to
          re-obtain the credential include re-requesting the credential from
          the issuer, or TBD.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a credential is issued to a recipient's DID, the recipient has the
          ability to prove ownership of a credential even if the recipient
          loses a private key used to show ownership of a credential referenced
          in a claim.
        </p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Yanny uses DIDs as subjects of its Verifiable Credentials. By using
          DIDs, Yanny is able to prove “ownership” of a credential. Even if
          Yanny loses the private keys corresponding to all keys referenced in
          the DID document, Yanny is able to invoke the update method on the
          DID to once again gain control over the DID, and therefore continue
          to use the Verifiable Credential.

          Emphasizes the full lifecycle of cryptographic key management; i.e.
          loss of control is handled in a first-class manner via DIDs, and not
          as an exceptional event.

      <h2>Prescriptions (healthcare)</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Alice wants help with her urinary tract infection (UTI) and is a bit
          touchy about her privacy. In the old days, she would have to make an
          appointment in-person and get a paper prescription to take to a
          pharmacy. She wants to save money and have peace of mind.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Because she lives in Seattle, Alice is in a state that allows Planned
          Parenthood to diagnose and prescribe online
          https://www.plannedparenthood.org/get-care/get-care-online . Alice
          uses the identity wallet on her iPhone to register with the online
          medical practice. She tells the online practice her name is Althea
          with password-less authentication and a verified driver's license
          credential to prove that she's a WA resident. The remote physician,
          Bob, is licensed by the WA Board of Medicine and credentialed by
          Planned Parenthood of WA, Inc. He's securely signed in using the
          identity wallet on his smartphone. Bob issues Alice a digital
          prescription in the form of a verifiable credential and allows Alice
          to download it however she pleases. Alice is a librarian and trusts
          her local public library to erase their logs as allowed by law. She
          uses one of their computers to sign-in and do all of this. She snaps
          a picture of the QR code that is the prescription to take to the
          pharmacy. Charlie, the licensed pharmacist, scans the prescription
          QR code and fills the prescription. Alice pays cash.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The challenge of this particular use-case is that only Bob and
          Charlie are verified identities and accountable for their interaction
          with Alice. Alice can be anonymous or pairwise-pseudonymous with both
          Bob and Charlie and everything just works. Alice, Bob, and Charlie
          all keep separate and legally authentic copies of the records of their
          interaction in case of dispute.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Distinction</h3>
        <p>
          The Prescription use-case is a common and high-value example of
          privacy engineering as we shift to convenient and cost-effective
          online commerce among licensed and unlicensed individuals as peers.
          Bob and Charlie benefit by reducing or even eliminating the influence
          of their respective institutions or employers and therefore make more
          money. They pass some savings to Alice who also gets increased peace
          of mind.

      <h2>Digital Executor (law)</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Today, when people die, there are no standard technologies for heirs,
          executors, or probate courts to properly take control of an individual's
          online accounts and digital assets. With a DID linked to accounts and
          assets, a DID owner could define a trigger for a third party to assume
          control over the DID Document. Ideally, this trigger would specify (a)
          an oracle (how to know the death/incapacity occurred), (b) a means for
          the new owner to assert control, and (c) appropriate checks and
          accountability.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Kathy uses DIDs to manage her authentications to various services.
          As part of her estate planning, she generates a unique credential
          that she gives to her attorney, Gloria, with provisions specified in
          her will, which initially lists Mike as the digital executor. With
          appropriate obfuscation, that credential is specified in multiple DID
          documents as a probate authority, with the authorization to change the
          master key in case of death, which shall be recorded publicly, on chain,
          as a notarized invocation of the probate authority. As it happens,
          Kathy had a falling out with Mike and notified Gloria just two weeks
          before her death that her friend Miyake should now be her digital
          executor. Upon Kathy's death, Gloria uses the probate credential to
          publicly record the assertion of probate and to replace the DID's master
          key with a new key, controlled by Miyake, who lives in Japan (Kathy,
          Gloria, and Mike live in the United States). Now, any system using
          Kathy's DIDs for authentication can programmatically recognized Miyake's
          authority <em>and</em> specifically know that Kathy's credentials were
          modified under a assertion of probate.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The late date change in digital executorship from Mike to Miyake
          could be problematic if Kathy had directly listed Mike's credential
          in the DID Document. Because she instead chose to rely on her attorney,
          Kathy has a more flexible way to direct her wishes, while still
          leveraging the collective control over her authenticated logins to
          various services. In addition, Miyake's geographic location could
          make it hard for them to travel to the United States and may make it
          difficult to provide proof of identity traditionally used by U.S. courts.
          Also, because Gloria invokes the probate mechanism, Miyake need only
          provide a suitable credential at that time; he did not need to create
          and maintain a credential over a long period of time (as would be the
          case if Gloria weren't involved).

      <h2>Single Sign On (security)</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Passwords are notoriously misused ("123456"), stolen from the
          supposedly-secure database on the server-side, easy to forget when
          sufficiently secure, and never the last word in authentication for
          forgotten password situations.  Proving control of a DID can replace
          storage and retrieval of a shared secret.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Use DID as single-sign-on to a website, using <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/draft-documents/did_auth_draft.md">DID Auth</a> (especially
          cases like the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/draft-documents/did_auth_draft.md#did-auth-architecture-6-web-page-and-web-browser">
          example between a web page and web browser with a mobile
          identity app</a>) directly or via the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">
          Credential Handler API</a>. When desirable, the relationship can add
          a shared secret for 2FA.
          <!--(except does DID Auth include any extensions that enable this
          subsequent ascension without starting another socket?).-->
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that what is stored on the server-side is a DID, so in cases
          where a successful attack reads (but does not mutate) the database,
          all that is revealed is linkage of the DID to use the site (so
          probably as a consequence the user should spawn a unique DID to reveal
          to that site), and any 2FA secret (which should be a random number for
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm">TOTP</a>,

          procedures remain valid after the hack, even for that site.
