        Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) allow for exceptional user-driven control 
        and overall reliability. While DIDs share many features with extant identity systems,
        no other system combines all the features designed into DIDs. Working with the
        various organizations implementing and deploying this technology in
        commercial environments, we have curated a set of use cases which illustrate
          these features.</p>

	<h2>Feature/Benefit Grid</h2>
		<p>In collecting and evaluating potential use cases, we have 
		identified fifteen (15) key features supported by the DID specification, 
		which provide benefits in the areas of anti-censorship, anti-exploitation,
		ease of use, privacy, and sustainability.<p>
		<p>The features and their associated benefits can be seen in the following 
        grid. A brief definition of each feature follows.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
	  <dl id="feature_definitions">
  <dt id="f1">1. Inter-jurisdictional</dt>
	<dd>Inter-jurisdictional identifiers do not depend on the legal jurisdiction 
      in which they are issued. They are valid for uses anywhere without loss 
      of fidelity or reliability. No jurisdiction is directly able to prevent 
      their use. (Anti-censorship and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f2">2. Can't be administratively denied</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers can't be denied or taken away by administrative 
        function. This prevents shifting politics and bad actors from 
        interfering. (Anti-censorship).</dd>
  <dt id="f3">3. Minimized rents</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers don't incur ongoing expenses if unused nor on a per 
        transaction basis. Fees based on updates—which incurs network and 
        computational costs to verify—are considered "minimal". (Anti-exploitation 
        and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f4">4. No vendor lock in</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are not dependent on any given vendor. Vendor-specific 
        identifiers restrict usage to that which is acceptable to the vendor and 
        may allow vendors to extract disproportionate rents for usage. 
        (Anti-exploitation, Privacy, and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f5">5. Self-issued, self-managed</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are created and managed by the subject of the identifier. 
        They are not assigned, given, sold, or rented to the individual using them. 
        The party relying on the identifier for identification, authentication, and 
        authorization, does not need to manage the creation, update, and recovery of 
        these identifiers. (Anti-censorship, Ease of use, and Privacy)</dd>
  <dt id="f6">6. Streamlined rotation</dt>
    <dd>When authentication materials need to be updated, these identifiers can 
        update without direct intervention with relying parties and with minimal 
        individual interaction. (Ease of use)</dd>
  <dt id="f7">7. No phone home</dt>
    <dd>When using these identifiers, there is no need to contact the issuer of the 
        identifier to verify it. Verification and authentication can occur without 
        further communication with the issuer. (Privacy)</dd>
  <dt id="f8">8. No surveillance capitalism</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers limit the effectiveness of surveillance capitalism by 
        minimizing cross-service correlatability. Individuals may use these 
        identifiers at multiple service providers without their activity being 
        tracked for collusion or third party embedded surveillance techniques like 
        cookies. (Anti-exploitation and Privacy).</dd>
  <dt id="f9">9. Cryptographic future proofing</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are capable of being updated as technology evolves. Current 
        cryptography techniques are known to be susceptible to quantum computational 
        attacks. Future-proofed identifiers provide a means to continue using the same 
        identifier with updated, advanced authentication and authorization technologies. 
        (Sustainable)</dd>
  <dt id="f10">10. Survives organizational mortality</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers survive the demise of the organization that issued them. They 
        usefulness of these identifiers survive organizations going out of business, 
        being purchased (and potentially losing domain names or root credentials), and 
        even the internal decay of an organization that no longer has the ability to 
        verify the authenticity of records they once issued.</dd>
  <dt id="f11">11. Survives deployment end-of-life</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are usable even after the systems deployed by relying parties 
        move past their useful lifetime. They are robust against technology fads and can 
        seamlessly work with both legacy and next-generation systems.</dd>
  <dt id="f12">12. Survives relationship with service provider</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are not dependent on the tenure of the relationship with a 
        service provider. This contrasts with identifiers like service-centric emails, 
        e.g., joe@aol.com, which when used as identifiers in other systems can cause 
        problems when individuals no longer use the service provider.</dd>
  <dt id="f13">13. Cryptographic authentication and communication</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers enable cryptographic techniques to authenticate individuals 
        and to secure communications with the subject of the identifier, typically using 
        public-private key pairs.</dd>
  <dt id="f14">14. Service discovery</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers allow relying parties to look up available service endpoints 
        for interacting with the subject of the identifier. (Ease of use and Sustainable)</dd>
  <dt id="f15">15. Registry agnostic</dt>
	    <dd>These identifiers are free to reside on any registry implementing a compatible 
          interface. They are not beholden to any particular technology or vendor.</dd>

        <section>
      <h3>Decentralized Corporate Identifiers (enterprise)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          There are many types of identifiers that corporations use today
          including tax identification numbers (e.g. 238-42-3893), Legal
          Entity Identifiers (e.g. 5493000IBP32UQZ0KL24), Data Universal
          Numbering System identifiers (aka. DUNS Number) (e.g. 150483782),
          and many more that communicate the unique identity of an organization.
          None of these numbers enable an organization to self-issue an
          identifier or to use the number to cryptographically authenticate or
          digitally sign agreements. A great number of business to business
          and business to custome transactions could be executed more quickly
          and with greater assurance of the validity of the transaction if a
          mechanism to self-issue cryptographic identifiers were created.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          A North American government would like to ensure that the supply
          chain that feeds electronic products into the country is secure. As
          a result, a new method of submitting digital documentation to Customs
          is enabled that requires that all documentation is provided as
          machine-readable digitally signed data. Digitally signed documentation
          is collected at each stage of the manufacturing, packaging, and
          shipping process. This documentation is then submitted to Customs
          upon the products entry into the country where all digital signatures
          are verified on the documentation. Some aspects of the signed
          documentation, such as firmware hashes and checksums, are then used
          by Customs and downstream customers to verify that the products have
          not been tampered with after leaving the manufacturing facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decentralized Identifiers are chosen in order to ensure 1) low
          management overhead for the government, 2) self-management of
          identifiers and cryptographic key material, and 3) a competitive
          marketplace.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The requirement of downstream customers to use the same documentation
          and digital signature mechanisms that were provided to Customs is the
          sticky wicket in this scenario. Governments often create ad-hoc
          solutions for their import solutions, which make securing the global
          supply chain difficult as each government has their own method of
          securing the supply chain and identifying corporations that downstream
          customers need to integrate with. If you are a global company, that
          means integrating with many supply chain systems (each with different
          capabilities). As such, any securing of the supply chain with downstream
          customers must then depend on the country-specific corporate
          identification and PKI solution, which leads to ad-hoc solutions that
          drive up the cost of doing business across borders.
        </p>
        <p>
          A supply chain identifier solution that is simple, self-administered,
          built on global standards, is flexible in the cryptographic mechanisms
          used to authenticate, and can be used by governments and downstream
          customers with little to no modification to the regional government
          or corporate systems does not exist today.

        <h4>Distinctions</h4>
        <p>
          Many Decentralized Identifier use cases focus on Self-Sovereign
          Identity and individuals. This use case focuses on organizations and
          their departments as entities that would also benefit from
          Decentralized Identifiers.

      <h3>Life-long, recipient-managed Credentials (education)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Educational <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> offer benefits over traditional
          educational credentials in that the recipient is able to store and
          share their credentials, and a third party may independently verify
          the credential (including authenticating the identity of the recipient),
		  without necessarily consulting the issuer, and without dependence on
		  centuries old treaty-based bureaucratic process for the international 
      verification of credentials. This provides the promise of recipient-owned 
		  long-lived credentials that the recipient may use in any country, 
		  even if the issuing institution goes out of business.
        </p>
        <p> However, traditional public-private key pair-based identifiers 
			present challenges for rotating keys, especially if 
			the identifier in a credential is simply the public key (with 
			the private key used for authentication).</p>
        <ol>
    		<li>With the public key embedded in the digitally signed credential, 
				it is literally impossible to update the signing key; a recipient 
				must  contact the issuer and request re-issuing with a new 
				identifer. If the issuer is not reachable, or is unwilling 
				or unable to issue a new credential, the recipient cannot 
				update the cryptographic material.</li>
			<li>If the credential relies on a centralized key registry or 
				authority for managing rotation, then that registry becomes 
				the centralized point of failure. This may or may not be an 
				improvement, especially for longer held credentials.</li>
			<li>If the credential's cryptographic technology becomes outdated, 
				there is no way to update the credential to use a more robust 
				technology; a recipient must contact the issuer for reissuance.</li>
		  </ol>
        <p>The key rotation is particularly problematic for credentials 
            expected to last a lifetime. It should be anticipated that 
			a given individual will change their key management strategy and 
		    systems several times over the course of their life, e.g., relying
		    on a cloud wallet, a mobile wallet, or a dedicated hardware wallet,
		    as their needs change.</p>
        <p>By issuing an educational credential to a recipient's DID, the 
			recipient has the ability to prove ownership of a credential even 
			if the cryptographic material used for authenticating changes over time.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>When Sally earned her master&rsquo;s degree at  Oxford, she received a 
			digital diploma which contained a decentralized identifier she provided. 
			Over time, she updates the cryptographic material associated with that 
			DID to use her latest hardware wallet, with biometric protections and a 
			quantum resistant algorithm. A decade after  graduation, she applies for 
			a job in Japan, for which she provides her digital diploma by uploading 
			it to the prospective employee&rsquo;s website. To verify she is the 
			actual recipient of that degree, she uses the decentralized identifier 
			to authenticate, using her current hardware wallet (with rotated keys). 
			In addition to the fact that her name matches the name on the diploma, 
			the cryptographic authentication provides a robust verification of her 
			claim, allowing the employer to rely on Sally&rsquo;s assertion that she 
			earned a master&rsquo;s degree from Oxford. </p>

        <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>Oxford had no need to provide services for  resetting or updating Sally&rsquo;s username or password; they had no role in  managing Sally&rsquo;s changes to her authentication credentials. The potential  employer did not need to contact Oxford to verify Sally&rsquo;s claim of a master&rsquo;s  degree; they were able to verify the credential and authenticate Sally&rsquo;s  identity with information retrieved over the Internet. </p>

      <h3>Prescriptions (healthcare)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Alice wants help with her urinary tract infection (UTI) and is a bit
          touchy about her privacy. In the old days, she would have to make an
          appointment in-person and get a paper prescription to take to a
          pharmacy. She wants to save money and have peace of mind.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Because she lives in Seattle, Alice is in a state that allows Planned
          Parenthood to diagnose and prescribe online
          https://www.plannedparenthood.org/get-care/get-care-online . Alice
          uses the identity wallet on her iPhone to register with the online
          medical practice. She tells the online practice her name is Althea
          with password-less authentication and a verified driver's license
          credential to prove that she's a WA resident. The remote physician,
          Bob, is licensed by the WA Board of Medicine and credentialed by
          Planned Parenthood of WA, Inc. He's securely signed in using the
          identity wallet on his smartphone. Bob issues Alice a digital
          prescription in the form of a verifiable credential and allows Alice
          to download it however she pleases. Alice is a librarian and trusts
          her local public library to erase their logs as allowed by law. She
          uses one of their computers to sign-in and do all of this. She snaps
          a picture of the QR code that is the prescription to take to the
          pharmacy. Charlie, the licensed pharmacist, scans the prescription
          QR code and fills the prescription. Alice pays cash.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The challenge of this particular use-case is that only Bob and
          Charlie are verified identities and accountable for their interaction
          with Alice. Alice can be anonymous or pairwise-pseudonymous with both
          Bob and Charlie and everything just works. Alice, Bob, and Charlie
          all keep separate and legally authentic copies of the records of their
          interaction in case of dispute.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>
          The Prescription use-case is a common and high-value example of
          privacy engineering as we shift to convenient and cost-effective
          online commerce among licensed and unlicensed individuals as peers.
          Bob and Charlie benefit by reducing or even eliminating the influence
          of their respective institutions or employers and therefore make more
          money. They pass some savings to Alice who also gets increased peace
          of mind.

      <h3>Digital Executor (law)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Today, when people die, there are no standard technologies for heirs,
          executors, or probate courts to properly take control of an individual's
          online accounts and digital assets. With a DID linked to accounts and
          assets, a DID owner could define a trigger for a third party to assume
          control over the DID Document. Ideally, this trigger would specify (a)
          an oracle (how to know the death/incapacity occurred), (b) a means for
          the new owner to assert control, and (c) appropriate checks and
          accountability.

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Kathy uses DIDs to manage her authentications to various services.
          As part of her estate planning, she generates a unique credential
          that she gives to her attorney, Gloria, with provisions specified in
          her will, which initially lists Mike as the digital executor. With
          appropriate obfuscation, that credential is specified in multiple DID
          documents as a probate authority, with the authorization to change the
          master key in case of death, which shall be recorded publicly, on chain,
          as a notarized invocation of the probate authority. As it happens,
          Kathy had a falling out with Mike and notified Gloria just two weeks
          before her death that her friend Miyake should now be her digital
          executor. Upon Kathy's death, Gloria uses the probate credential to
          publicly record the assertion of probate and to replace the DID's master
          key with a new key, controlled by Miyake, who lives in Japan (Kathy,
          Gloria, and Mike live in the United States). Now, any system using
          Kathy's DIDs for authentication can programmatically recognized Miyake's
          authority <em>and</em> specifically know that Kathy's credentials were
          modified under a assertion of probate.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The late date change in digital executorship from Mike to Miyake
          could be problematic if Kathy had directly listed Mike's credential
          in the DID Document. Because she instead chose to rely on her attorney,
          Kathy has a more flexible way to direct her wishes, while still
          leveraging the collective control over her authenticated logins to
          various services. In addition, Miyake's geographic location could
          make it hard for them to travel to the United States and may make it
          difficult to provide proof of identity traditionally used by U.S. courts.
          Also, because Gloria invokes the probate mechanism, Miyake need only
          provide a suitable credential at that time; he did not need to create
          and maintain a credential over a long period of time (as would be the
          case if Gloria weren't involved).

      <h3>Single Sign On (security)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Passwords are notoriously misused ("123456"), stolen from the
          supposedly-secure database on the server-side, easy to forget when
          sufficiently secure, and never the last word in authentication for
          forgotten password situations.  Proving control of a DID can replace
          storage and retrieval of a shared secret.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Use DID as single-sign-on to a website, using <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/draft-documents/did_auth_draft.md">DID Auth</a> (especially
          cases like the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/draft-documents/did_auth_draft.md#did-auth-architecture-6-web-page-and-web-browser">
          example between a web page and web browser with a mobile
          identity app</a>) directly or via the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">
          Credential Handler API</a>. When desirable, the relationship can add
          a shared secret for 2FA.
          <!--(except does DID Auth include any extensions that enable this
          subsequent ascension without starting another socket?).-->
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that what is stored on the server-side is a DID, so in cases
          where a successful attack reads (but does not mutate) the database,
          all that is revealed is linkage of the DID to use the site (so
          probably as a consequence the user should spawn a unique DID to reveal
          to that site), and any 2FA secret (which should be a random number for
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm">TOTP</a>,
          instead of a <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/on-phone-numbers-and-identity-423db8577e58">phone number</a>

          procedures remain valid after the hack, even for that site.
