        Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) allow for exceptional user-driven control 
        and overall reliability of publicly resolvable, provable identifiers. While 
        DIDs share many features with extant identity systems,
        no other system combines all the features designed into DIDs. We present the 
          current consensus of the motivations behind DIDs based on input and 
          collaboration with implementers currently building products to the DID specification.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document attempts to explain what you can do with DIDs and why you might care to use them. We start by describing the basic conceptual framework for DIDs, including basic terminology, followed by the actions one can take with a DID. Then we introduce the defining features and benefits of DIDs along with five focal use cases illustrating those features and benefits. 
        </p>
      </section>
    <section>
      <h2>What can you do with a DID?</h2>
        <p>Decentralized  identifiers enable several key actions by individual actors. These actions are  the functional interface for working with DIDs and involve three entities. The Controller,  the Relying Party, and the Subject.</p>
        <p>Controllers create  and control DIDs, while Relying Parties rely on DIDs as an identifier for  interactions related to the Subject.</p>
        <p>The Subject is  the entity referred to by the DID, which can be literally anything: a person,  an organization, a device, a location, even a concept. Typically, the Subject is  also the Controller, but in cases of guardianship, agents (human or software),  and inanimate Subjects, this is not possible. As such, the Subject has no functional  role. When the Subject is, in fact, the Controller, we consider the action to  be taken by the Controller on their own behalf as the Subject. When the Subject  is not the Controller, the Controller is said to be taking action on behalf of the Subject, such as when an employee manages a DID on behalf of their employer  or a parent uses a DID on behalf of their child.</p>
        <p>The Controller  and Relying Party may be an individuals or interactive systems, but for  simplicity in this document, we refer to both as if they were individual  persons performing these actions. </p>
        <p>Only a Controller  can perform the actions that control a DID, however, anyone can act as a  Relying Party for any DID they know, including the Controller should they wish  to inspect or verify their own DID.</p>
        <p>As a use case  document, we define these actions in terms of the eventual systems we  anticipate using this specification. The initial DID Working Group Charter only  covers the initial specification of the DID syntax itself and the syntax and  semantics of its associated DID Document. Together, these encode the information  necessary to eventually perform these various actions. Additional  specifications, such as DID Resolution and DID Auth (both under incubation in  the Credentials Community Group), will specify how these actions take place. There  has been interest expressed in standardizing how DIDs can be used for signing  and how those signatures are verified, however it is an open question as to  whether or not this capability should be a part of the DID Auth specification  or a separate work. This document captures these uses as design goals, but it is  anticipated that the DID Specification will not define how these actions are realized.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most salient point about Decentralized Identifiers is that there are no "Identity  Providers". Instead, this role is subsumed in the decentralized systems that Controllers  use to manage DIDs and, in turn, Relying Parties use to apply DIDs. These  decentralized systems, which we refer to as DID registries, are designed to  operate independently from any particular service provider and hence, free from  any given platform authority. Most current DID methods use distributed ledger technology (DLT) for their registries, for example, BTCR uses Bitcoin and ERC725  uses Ethereum. Some use alternative decentralized technologies, as IPID, which  uses IPFS. You may see the current DID Methods at the DID Method Registry (<a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/">https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-registry/</a>), maintained by the Credentials Community Group. </p>
        <p>In practice, the definition and operation of all current decentralized systems retain some elements of centralized control. Depending on the criteria one uses to evaluate  such systems—from who controls the most widely used code base to who controls  the specification—where a system resides on the spectrum of centralized and decentralized varies. However, the design of DIDs is a separate matter from the  academic debate about how decentralized any particular DID registry is.</p>
        <p>The DID methods specified in each DID MAY define how one performs these actions, including the  mechanism(s) for interacting with any particular DID registry. Not all of these  actions are supported by all DID methods. Which actions are required is an open  question. Similarly, it remains an open question whether or not all DID methods  should be required to be decentralized. As mentioned previously, this quickly becomes  an academic debate about the definition of decentralized, which we leave as an  exercise for the reader. Therefore, each DID method and DID registry should be  evaluated on its own merits as to precisely how decentralized it may or may not  be relative to its anticipated use. </p>
        <p>DIDs, DID methods,  DID registries, and DID Documents are anticipated design elements in the DID  specification. For illustration we use these elements in this document. When we  refer to methods and registries, we mean DID methods and DID registries. All  DIDs resolve to DID Documents. DID Documents contain the cryptographic material  to perform the functions related to that particular DID, including associated  proof methods and service endpoints. When working with DIDs, the DID Document  is first resolved, then further dereferencing may return a resource, as is  typical for URLs. We use this design framework to describe DID actions.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
      <h2>DID Actions</h2>
        <p>Here are the  eleven (13) actions currently supported by DIDs as envisioned by Credentials  Community Group and as intended in the DID Working Group Charter. </p>
        <p>In the diagram,  we have grouped the actions by Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) as well  as Use.</p>
            <img src="images/did_actions.png"/>
      <section>
        <h2>Create</h2>
        <p>Controllers create DIDs, uniquely binding cryptographic  proofs with the identifier, typically using public-private key-pairs. These  DIDs are recorded in a registry in such a manner as to be able to resolve to a  DID Document. The DID Document may be dynamically and deterministically  generated through resolution or it may be explicitly constructed as a  stand-alone resource and either stored or referenced in the registry. This  process needs access to the registry, ideally a decentralized system, and like  the rest of the DID CRUD actions, can be performed without interaction with any  particular authority.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Present</h2>
        <p>DIDs are URIs, which is to say a string of characters. As  such, they may be presented in the same manner as URIs, by simply transmitting  or presenting that string of characters. DIDs, however are not designed to be  human readable. They invariably contain long, complex numbers represented in  various formats. For ease of use, implementations often rely on QR codes for  ease of capture using a camera-enabled device such as a smart phone.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Authenticate</h2>
        <p>Relying Parties may wish to prove that the individual  presenting a DID is in fact its controller or specified as a Controller for a  particular service endpoint. This authentication process uses the cryptographic  material in the DID Document to test if the claimed Controller can, in fact, prove  control, typically through some sort of challenge-response. Some DID Documents  and methods allow for separate, proofs for different service endpoints,  distinct from update and delete actions. This separation allows transactional  proofs that are expected to be used frequently, while controlling proofs are  used rarely.</p>
        </section>
            <section>
        <h2>Sign</h2>
        <p>Using cryptographic material associated with that found in a  DID Document, DID Controllers may sign digital assets or documents. This  signature can later be verified (#7 Signature Verification) to demonstrate the  authenticity of the asset. In this way, we may referred to the asset as "signed  by the DID".</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Resolve</h2>
        <p>The first step in using a DID for anything other than  presentation is to resolve the DID to a specific DID Document, to reveal the  cryptographic material and service endpoints associated with that DID. How this  occurs is method-specific and currently under development in the DID Resolution  specification. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Dereference</h2>
        <p>Dereferencing a DID uses the material in its DID Document to  return a resource. By default, dereferencing a DID without a reference to service  endpoint returns the DID Document itself. When a DID contains a service name,  dereferencing returns the resource pointed to from the named service endpoint,  which was discovered by resolving the DID to its DID Document and looking up  the endpoint by name. In this way, a Relying Party may dynamically discover and  interact with the current service endpoints for a given DID.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Verify Signature</h2>
        <p>Given a digital asset signed by a DID, a Relying Party may  use the cryptographic material in the DID Document to verify the signature.</p>
        <h2>Rotate</h2>
        <p>Controllers may rotate the cryptographic material for a DID  by updating the DID Document as recorded in its registry. Different methods  handle this differently, but the result is an update to the core cryptographic  proof required to prove control of the DID and the DID Document.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Modify Service Endpoint</h2>
        <p>Controllers may change service endpoints associated with a  DID, including the proof mechanism for authenticating as the Subject for any  given endpoint. The process for doing this is method specific, but is designed  to allow Controllers to make these change without necessarily changing the  primary proof mechanism for control of the DID itself.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Forward / Migrate</h2>
        <p>To support interoperability, some methods provide a way for  controllers to record in the registry (by updating the DID Document), that the  DID should be redirected to another DID, which now has full authority to represent  the originating DID. This mechanism allows DID controllers to migrate a DID  from one method or registry to another.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Recover</h2>
        <p>Some methods provide means for recovering control of a DID  if its existing private cryptographic material is lost. These means vary by  method but can include social recovery, multi-sig, Shamir sharing, or pre-rotated  keys. In general, recovery triggers a rotation to a new proof, allowing the  Controller of that new proof to recover control of the DID without interacting  with any Relying Parties.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Audit</h2>
        <p>Some methods provide an explicit audit trail of all CRUD  actions on that DID, including a timestamp for when the actions took place. For  distributed ledger-based registries, this audit trail is fundamental to the way  the ledgers record transactions. This allows relying parties to see, for  example, how recently a DID was rotated or its service endpoints updated, which  may inform certain analytics regarding the reliability of the DID's  cryptographic material.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Revoke</h2>
        <p>Instead of deleting a DID, Controllers can revoke a DID such  that downstream processes like authentication and dereferencing are no longer functional.  Most decentralized systems cannot guarantee actual deletion of a record.  Indeed, distributed ledgers are often touted as "immutable". Methods define  revocation processes to achieve the same effect as deletion. The mechanisms for  revocation vary based on the method.</p>

	<h2>Feature/Benefit Grid</h2>
		<p>In collecting and evaluating potential use cases, we have 
		identified fifteen (15) key features supported by the DID specification, 
		which provide benefits in the areas of anti-censorship, anti-exploitation,
		ease of use, privacy, and sustainability.<p>

  <dt id="f3">3. Minimized rents</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers don't incur ongoing expenses if unused nor on a per 
        transaction basis. Fees based on updates—which incurs network and 
        computational costs to verify—are considered "minimal". (Anti-exploitation 
        and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f4">4. No vendor lock in</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are not dependent on any given vendor. Vendor-specific 
        identifiers restrict usage to that which is acceptable to the vendor and 
        may allow vendors to extract disproportionate rents for usage. 
        (Anti-exploitation, Privacy, and Sustainable).</dd>
  <dt id="f5">5. Self-issued, self-managed</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are created and managed by the subject of the identifier. 
        They are not assigned, given, sold, or rented to the individual using them. 
        The party relying on the identifier for identification, authentication, and 
        authorization, does not need to manage the creation, update, and recovery of 
        these identifiers. (Anti-censorship, Ease of use, and Privacy)</dd>
  <dt id="f6">6. Streamlined rotation</dt>

  <dt id="f8">8. No surveillance capitalism</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers limit the effectiveness of surveillance capitalism by 
        minimizing cross-service correlatability. Individuals may use these

  <dt id="f9">9. Cryptographic future proofing</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are capable of being updated as technology evolves. Current 
        cryptography techniques are known to be susceptible to quantum computational

        verify the authenticity of records they once issued.</dd>
  <dt id="f11">11. Survives deployment end-of-life</dt>

        seamlessly work with both legacy and next-generation systems.</dd>
  <dt id="f12">12. Survives relationship with service provider</dt>
    <dd>These identifiers are not dependent on the tenure of the relationship with a

        <h2>Focal Use Cases</h2>
        <section>
      <h3>Decentralized Corporate Identifiers (enterprise)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          There are many types of identifiers that corporations use today
          including tax identification numbers (e.g. 238-42-3893), Legal
          Entity Identifiers (e.g. 5493000IBP32UQZ0KL24), Data Universal
          Numbering System identifiers (aka. DUNS Number) (e.g. 150483782),
          and many more that communicate the unique identity of an organization.
          None of these numbers enable an organization to self-issue an
          identifier or to use the number to cryptographically authenticate or
          digitally sign agreements. A great number of business to business
          and business to customer transactions could be executed more quickly
          and with greater assurance of the validity of the transaction if a
          mechanism to self-issue cryptographic identifiers were created.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          A North American government would like to ensure that the supply
          chain that feeds electronic products into the country is secure. As
          a result, a new method of submitting digital documentation to Customs
          is enabled that requires that all documentation is provided as
          machine-readable digitally signed data. Digitally signed documentation
          is collected at each stage of the manufacturing, packaging, and
          shipping process. This documentation is then submitted to Customs
          upon the products entry into the country where all digital signatures
          are verified on the documentation. Some aspects of the signed
          documentation, such as firmware hashes and checksums, are then used
          by Customs and downstream customers to verify that the products have
          not been tampered with after leaving the manufacturing facility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decentralized Identifiers are chosen in order to ensure 1) low
          management overhead for the government, 2) self-management of
          identifiers and cryptographic key material, and 3) a competitive
          marketplace.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The requirement of downstream customers to use the same documentation
          and digital signature mechanisms that were provided to Customs is the
          sticky wicket in this scenario. Governments often create ad-hoc
          solutions for their import solutions, which make securing the global
          supply chain difficult as each government has their own method of
          securing the supply chain and identifying corporations that downstream
          customers need to integrate with. If you are a global company, that
          means integrating with many supply chain systems (each with different
          capabilities). As such, any securing of the supply chain with downstream
          customers must then depend on the country-specific corporate
          identification and PKI solution, which leads to ad-hoc solutions that
          drive up the cost of doing business across borders.
        </p>
        <p>
          A supply chain identifier solution that is simple, self-administered,
          built on global standards, is flexible in the cryptographic mechanisms
          used to authenticate, and can be used by governments and downstream
          customers with little to no modification to the regional government
          or corporate systems does not exist today.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Distinctions</h4>
        <p>
          Many Decentralized Identifier use cases focus on Self-Sovereign
          Identity and individuals. This use case focuses on organizations and
          their departments as entities that would also benefit from
          Decentralized Identifiers.

      <h3>Life-long, recipient-managed Credentials (education)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>Educational <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> offer benefits over traditional
          educational credentials in that the recipient is able to store and
          share their credentials, and a third party may independently verify
          the credential (including authenticating the identity of the recipient),
		  without necessarily consulting the issuer, and without dependence on
		  centuries old treaty-based bureaucratic process for the international 
      verification of credentials. This provides the promise of recipient-owned 
		  long-lived credentials that the recipient may use in any country, 
		  even if the issuing institution goes out of business.
        </p>
        <p> However, traditional public-private key pair-based identifiers 
			present challenges for rotating keys, especially if 
			the identifier in a credential is simply the public key (with 
			the private key used for authentication).</p>
        <ol>
    		<li>With the public key embedded in the digitally signed credential, 
				it is literally impossible to update the signing key; a recipient 
				must  contact the issuer and request re-issuing with a new 
				identifer. If the issuer is not reachable, or is unwilling 
				or unable to issue a new credential, the recipient cannot 
				update the cryptographic material.</li>
			<li>If the credential relies on a centralized key registry or 
				authority for managing rotation, then that registry becomes 
				the centralized point of failure. This may or may not be an 
				improvement, especially for longer held credentials.</li>
			<li>If the credential's cryptographic technology becomes outdated, 
				there is no way to update the credential to use a more robust 
				technology; a recipient must contact the issuer for reissuance.</li>
		  </ol>
        <p>The key rotation is particularly problematic for credentials 
            expected to last a lifetime. It should be anticipated that 
			a given individual will change their key management strategy and 
		    systems several times over the course of their life, e.g., relying
		    on a cloud wallet, a mobile wallet, or a dedicated hardware wallet,
		    as their needs change.</p>
        <p>By issuing an educational credential to a recipient's DID, the 
			recipient has the ability to prove ownership of a credential even 
			if the cryptographic material used for authenticating changes over time.
        </p>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>When Sally earned her master&rsquo;s degree at  Oxford, she received a 
			digital diploma which contained a decentralized identifier she provided. 
			Over time, she updates the cryptographic material associated with that 
			DID to use her latest hardware wallet, with biometric protections and a 
			quantum resistant algorithm. A decade after  graduation, she applies for 
			a job in Japan, for which she provides her digital diploma by uploading 
			it to the prospective employee&rsquo;s website. To verify she is the 
			actual recipient of that degree, she uses the decentralized identifier 
			to authenticate, using her current hardware wallet (with rotated keys). 
			In addition to the fact that her name matches the name on the diploma, 
			the cryptographic authentication provides a robust verification of her 
			claim, allowing the employer to rely on Sally&rsquo;s assertion that she 
			earned a master&rsquo;s degree from Oxford. </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>Rotating keys without invalidating Sally's educational credentials and 
			providing acceptable proof of education internationally.</p>
</section>
      <section>
        <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>Oxford had no need to provide services for  resetting or updating Sally&rsquo;s username or password; they had no role in  managing Sally&rsquo;s changes to her authentication credentials. The potential  employer did not need to contact Oxford to verify Sally&rsquo;s claim of a master&rsquo;s  degree; they were able to verify the credential and authenticate Sally&rsquo;s  identity with information retrieved over the Internet. </p>

      <h3>Prescriptions (healthcare)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Alice wants help with her urinary tract infection (UTI) and is a bit
          touchy about her privacy. In the old days, she would have to make an
          appointment in-person and get a paper prescription to take to a
          pharmacy. She wants to save money and have peace of mind.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Because she lives in Seattle, Alice is in a state that allows Planned
          Parenthood to diagnose and prescribe online
          https://www.plannedparenthood.org/get-care/get-care-online . Alice
          uses the identity wallet on her iPhone to register with the online
          medical practice. She tells the online practice her name is Althea
          with password-less authentication and a verified driver's license
          credential to prove that she's a WA resident. The remote physician,
          Bob, is licensed by the WA Board of Medicine and credentialed by
          Planned Parenthood of WA, Inc. He's securely signed in using the
          identity wallet on his smartphone. Bob issues Alice a digital
          prescription in the form of a verifiable credential and allows Alice
          to download it however she pleases. Alice is a librarian and trusts
          her local public library to erase their logs as allowed by law. She
          uses one of their computers to sign-in and do all of this. She snaps
          a picture of the QR code that is the prescription to take to the
          pharmacy. Charlie, the licensed pharmacist, scans the prescription
          QR code and fills the prescription. Alice pays cash.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The challenge of this particular use-case is that only Bob and
          Charlie are verified identities and accountable for their interaction
          with Alice. Alice can be anonymous or pairwise-pseudonymous with both
          Bob and Charlie and everything just works. Alice, Bob, and Charlie
          all keep separate and legally authentic copies of the records of their
          interaction in case of dispute.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>
          The Prescription use-case is a common and high-value example of
          privacy engineering as we shift to convenient and cost-effective
          online commerce among licensed and unlicensed individuals as peers.
          Bob and Charlie benefit by reducing or even eliminating the influence
          of their respective institutions or employers and therefore make more
          money. They pass some savings to Alice who also gets increased peace
          of mind.

      <h3>Digital Executor (law)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Today, when people die, there are no standard technologies for heirs,
          executors, or probate courts to properly take control of an individual's
          online accounts and digital assets. With a DID linked to accounts and
          assets, a DID owner could define a trigger for a third party to assume
          control over the DID Document. Ideally, this trigger would specify (a)
          an oracle (how to know the death/incapacity occurred), (b) a means for
          the new owner to assert control, and (c) appropriate checks and
          accountability.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Kathy uses DIDs to manage her authentications to various services.
          As part of her estate planning, she generates a unique credential
          that she gives to her attorney, Gloria, with provisions specified in
          her will, which initially lists Mike as the digital executor. With
          appropriate obfuscation, that credential is specified in multiple DID
          documents as a probate authority, with the authorization to change the
          master key in case of death, which shall be recorded publicly, on chain,
          as a notarized invocation of the probate authority. As it happens,
          Kathy had a falling out with Mike and notified Gloria just two weeks
          before her death that her friend Miyake should now be her digital
          executor. Upon Kathy's death, Gloria uses the probate credential to
          publicly record the assertion of probate and to replace the DID's master
          key with a new key, controlled by Miyake, who lives in Japan (Kathy,
          Gloria, and Mike live in the United States). Now, any system using
          Kathy's DIDs for authentication can programmatically recognized Miyake's
          authority <em>and</em> specifically know that Kathy's credentials were
          modified under a assertion of probate.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          The late date change in digital executorship from Mike to Miyake
          could be problematic if Kathy had directly listed Mike's credential
          in the DID Document. Because she instead chose to rely on her attorney,
          Kathy has a more flexible way to direct her wishes, while still
          leveraging the collective control over her authenticated logins to
          various services. In addition, Miyake's geographic location could
          make it hard for them to travel to the United States and may make it
          difficult to provide proof of identity traditionally used by U.S. courts.
          Also, because Gloria invokes the probate mechanism, Miyake need only
          provide a suitable credential at that time; he did not need to create
          and maintain a credential over a long period of time (as would be the
          case if Gloria weren't involved).

      <h3>Single Sign On (security)</h3>
      <section>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
          Passwords are notoriously misused ("123456"), stolen from the
          supposedly-secure database on the server-side, easy to forget when
          sufficiently secure, and never the last word in authentication for
          forgotten password situations.  Proving control of a DID can replace
          storage and retrieval of a shared secret.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Use DID as single-sign-on to a website, using <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot6-santabarbara/blob/master/draft-documents/did_auth_draft.md">DID Auth</a> (especially
          cases like the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rebooting-the-web-of-trust-spring2018/blob/master/draft-documents/did_auth_draft.md#did-auth-architecture-6-web-page-and-web-browser">
          example between a web page and web browser with a mobile
          identity app</a>) directly or via the <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">
          Credential Handler API</a>. When desirable, the relationship can add
          a shared secret for 2FA.
          <!--(except does DID Auth include any extensions that enable this
          subsequent ascension without starting another socket?).-->
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that what is stored on the server-side is a DID, so in cases
          where a successful attack reads (but does not mutate) the database,
          all that is revealed is linkage of the DID to use the site (so
          probably as a consequence the user should spawn a unique DID to reveal
          to that site), and any 2FA secret (which should be a random number for
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm">TOTP</a>,
          instead of a <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/on-phone-numbers-and-identity-423db8577e58">phone number</a>

          procedures remain valid after the hack, even for that site.
